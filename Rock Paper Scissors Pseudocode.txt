Rock-Paper-Scissors Pseudocode
------------------------------

create class player with properties: type, choice, wins

create an object computer of class player and set type = computer, choice = "", wins = 0 
create an object human of class player and set type = human, choice = "", wins = 0

repeat 5 times...
in every iteration:
    let the computer make a choice and assign it to computer.choice // call computer random choice function
    show up prompt
    let the user input his choice and assign it to human.choice
    perform a plausibility check on human.choice
    if not passed throw error and cancel else go on
    if human.choice == Rock and computer.choice == Paper then computer wins => count computer.wins +1
    if human.choice == Rock and computer.choice == Scissors then player wins => count player.wins +1
    if human.choice == Rock and computer.choice == Rock then draw 
    if human.choice == Scissors and computer.choice ==  Paper then player wins => count player.wins +1
    if human.choice == Scissors and computer.choice ==  Rock then computer wins => count computer.wins +1
    if human.choice == Scissors and computer.choice ==  Scissors then draw
    if human.choice == Paper and computer.choice ==  Paper then draw 
    if human.choice == Paper and computer.choice ==  Rock then player wins => count player.wins +1
    if human.choice == Paper and computer.choice ==  Scissors then computer wins => count computer.wins +1
    display winner of the round
...
display winner of the game

computer random choice function:
    create empty string variable computerChoice
    create/call function getRandomInt with a return value of 0, 1 or 2
    if return value from getRandomInt == 0 then botCounterpartChoice is "Rock"
    if return value from getRandomInt == 1 then botCounterpartChoice is "Paper"
    if return value from getRandomInt == 2 then botCounterpartChoice is "Scissors"
    return computerChoice
